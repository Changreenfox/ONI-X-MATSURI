# Oni X Matsuri || 鬼ｘ祭
This game is a reimagined 2D side-scrolling platformer game that features evil Oni (Japanese for demon) that invaded the Summer Festival, led by an OniBoss, who sits atop the festival taiko drum tower. The player character is a samurai cat who must fight through the Oni and defeat their evil leader to save the Summer Festival, through movement challenges and fun power-ups. 

The game is built on a Godot engine, using C# scripting. Over the course of 2023, a console, along with a supporting controller, will be released. Additionally, more enemy types and levels will be added soon!
